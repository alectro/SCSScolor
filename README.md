# SCSScolor
A SCSS starter to create harmonic color palettes based on color wheel schemes.

## How to
1. Open **scss/colorcalc.scss**.
2. Edit the values for Hue, Saturation, Lightness and Alpha in **$h**, **$s**, **$l**, **$a**.
3. Save and compile.

## Color Schemes

### Complementary
Complementary schemes are created by combining colors from opposite sides of the color wheel.
Colors are **180 degrees** separated in the color wheel.

### Split Complementary
Split complementary schemes use colors that are on either side of the hue opposite your base hue.
Colors are **150 degrees** separated in the color wheel in each direction.

### Analogous
Analogous color schemes are the next easiest to create. Analogous schemes are created by using three colors that are next to each other on the 12-spoke color wheel.
Colors are **30 degrees** separated in the color wheel in each direction.

### Triadic
Triadic schemes are made up of hues equally spaced around the 12-spoke color wheel.
Colors are **120 degrees** separated in the color wheel in each direction.

### Tetradic Rectangle
Four colors arranged into two complementary color pairs.
A set of complimentary colors plus their **60 degrees** separated in the color wheel.

### Tetradic Square
Four colors arranged into two complementary color pairs.
A set of complimentary colors plus their **90 degrees** separated in the color wheel.
